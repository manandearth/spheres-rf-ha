* Working dev
At the moment [2019-01-02 Wed] 
- C-c M-j
- (require '[figwheel-sidecar-repl-api :as fw])
- (fw/start-figwheel!)
- (fw/cljs-repl)
then for the CSS that's in clj,-  M-x cider-connect-sibling-clj
** TODO this can be automated with a user.clj in the root. find out.
* deployment
** github pages
cracked it finally... [2019-01-03 Thu]
- add a remote 'github' - git remote add github https://github.com/manandearth/spheres-rf-ha.git
- created a branch 'gh-pages' - git branch gh-pages
- checkout to it -  git checkout gh-pages
- need index.html at root with correct paths to css and js
- I had to comment out resources/public/resources/js from the .gitignore
- from the project.clj I had to delete ["garden" "once"] from the :preptasks
- lein clean
- lein cljsbuild once min
- git add . and git commit -m ""
- git push github gh-pages
- *ISSUE* - when I committed changed to the index.html in github website, I had to -> git pull github gh-pages
** heroku
the master branch is the one used in the Heroku deployment.  It does
not require the index file at root, but perhapas in the next commit it
might well be the same as the github pages.
* development
** db
*** DONE redesign:
****  there should be for :spheres key a val which is a map first planets, second their satelites:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:spheres {:planet1 {:mass
                     :volume
                     ,,,
                     :satelites {:satelite1 {:mass
                                             :volume
                                             ,,,}
                                 :satelite2 {,,,
                                             }}
                     }
           :planet2 (:mass
                     ;;;
                     )}}

#+END_SRC
When moving a preset, to demonstrate distances (apoapsis and
periapsis) i will need to reset the planet's (or Sun) to be the point
of reference for distance.
**** DONE every sphere will have 2 vis keys:
1. :included - for when its system is selected
2. :vis - when it is toggled on from the list

The rest of the functions need be updated so that the body-menu shows
just the spheres available in the system and so on...
**** look at designing functions that construct entries and use the entries
the records.cljs can be made to create a language of usage of the
entries to depend less on reframe subs, be more coherent.
**** understand how spec can help in contructing
Is spec necessary, when I supply the data?  Will I need to construct
or the user, and therefor require validation of the attributes?
*** TODO Another design solution can be 
to have a key that gives the value for periapsis and apoapsis in the
system of which a planet is parent.
*** DONE add more moons for all systems
*** TODO spec it
see how to spec in order to accept input from user
** main-view
** functionality
*** DONE the different attributes need to pop the unit name (km kg days...) at the table axes.
*** NEXT the preset parent need to have a zero value for periapsis and apoapsis
the difficulty is how to condition that, it requires that the scale
will change accordingly and that the original value will not be lost
for when the selected preset changes.
*** TODO not sure what data to bring in on hover...
- the x and the y?
- a list of attributes of the body?
- what else changes, sphere size?
*** DONE add scale in main-view
*** DONE create presets, groups of bodies as views
This way we avoid having comparisons that don't make sense.
This will require redesigning the re-frame db.
*** TODO Have a look at adding reg-event-fx
effects can be dispached this way: one, many, or even dispatch-later ...
** visual
*** TODO as I need an intro we must find a better suited bg to take smaller fonts.
*** TODO how to make scale work. It is a CSS question..
both for elements in the page as well as for elemnts in the main view.
The spheres can change size with inclusion and exclusion
** more pages
perhaps an explaination, an about, in a different frame. history..

* data
** sources
- wikipedia, NASA, whatever sites..
- as the database is getting fuller I could just add an entry every day or so to populate further.
-
** new fields of interest
What other interesting fields I should add? 
*** look generally at the other fields in wikipedia (gravity, angle..) 
what can be insightful? unusual? 
what other boolean fields can I add?

** implementation
